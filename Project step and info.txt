Deep Learning Homework Title: Disease-gene interaction prediction with graph neural networks Desciption: The goal of this project is to create a graph neural network for predicting disease-gene associations. Working with DisGeNET, a comprehensive database of these associations, you'll apply deep learning to an important challenge of bioinformatics. By choosing this project, you'll gain experience in the intersection of deep learning and bioinformatics while extracting valuable insights from real-world data. Dataset: https://www.disgenet.org/
