Problem Description:

The objective is to develop a graph neural network (GNN) that predicts disease-gene associations using data from DisGeNET, a comprehensive database of such associations. This involves applying deep learning techniques to bioinformatics data to uncover insights into how genes and diseases are interconnected.

Steps to Solve the Problem:

Data Preparation:

Preprocess the data to fit the GNN input requirements.
Construct a graph where nodes represent genes and diseases, and edges represent associations.
Split the data into training and testing sets.

Baseline Model:

Implement a simple model (e.g., logistic regression) to serve as a performance benchmark.
Evaluate its performance on the dataset.

Model Development:

Develop a GNN model using PyTorch Geometric.
Reference architectures from the related papers (GCN, GraphSAGE).
Train the model on the prepared data.

Basic Evaluation:

Assess the GNN model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy and ROC-AUC.
Compare the results with the baseline model.
Analyze the findings to draw insights into disease-gene interactions.
